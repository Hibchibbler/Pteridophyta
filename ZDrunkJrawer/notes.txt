There is a global gravity that rotates with fixed increments, and at fixed rates
Each cavern has its own local gravity that can be modified permanantly.
The gravity experienced in a cavern is the sum of the global gravity, and the local gravity.
Levels designed to make cavern traversal dependent on specific angles of gravity.
SKill/Item that allows permanently gravitational modifications.

----------
caverns - radically swap orientations, frantically trying to kill monsters, and opponents. Gravity is the enemy, not an ability.
